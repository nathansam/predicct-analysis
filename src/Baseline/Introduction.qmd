This section of the website explores the baseline data for the PREdiCCt study,
generating inferences and producing display items for publication.

There are three main data sources for baseline demographic and phenotypic data
in PREdiCCt: 

1. Participant questionnaires.
1. Forms completed by a subject's clinical team (via REDCap) during recruitment.
1. Data collected retrospectively during the end-of-study (EoS) phenotyping
   which was completed by a member of the subject's IBD care team.

As all three are used, it will be made clear which source the data
presented originate from. 

A docker image, [nathansam/predicct](#future-link), has been used to ensure this 
analysis remains reproducible.
