This report explores associations between time to flare and the variables
recorded at baseline. Time to flare is modelled
using Cox models with the variable of interest and controlled variables (sex,
and deprivation) included as fixed effects. A gamma
frailty term is employed for hospital sites (which may capture inter-hospital
differences).

The primary study endpoint is soft flare which is defined as a participant
reporting their disease as being uncontrolled when they completed a monthly
study questionnaire. 

For soft flares, only the first two years of follow-up are considered as this
was the time interval in which questionnaires were sent to participants. 

The secondary study endpoint is hard flare, which required elevated CRP and/or
CRP and for the subject to change medication. Data for this endpoint was
collected via end-of-study phenotyping. 

For hard flares, the full study follow-up period has been used, from study
recruitment to the time the end of study phenotyping was completed. 

Soft and hard flares have been identified by Dr Linda Williams, the PREdiCCt
trial statistician. The same flare definitions have been used across all teams
working on PREdiCCt.
