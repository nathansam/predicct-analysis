## About

To-do

This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of
their care and support. We are very grateful to participants and their IBD care
teams for their support. Without your contributions, this study would not have
been possible. 

## Using this website

The navigation menu at the top of the page will allow you to navigate through
the steps of the analysis pipeline.  The code button at the top of each page can
be used to show all code blocks instead of clicking on the code buttons for each
individual block of code. Moving the mouse pointer over any citations in a
report will produce a pop up box with reference details. Clicking on the
citation will link to the bibliography at the bottom of the page. 

## Software versions

All analyses have been generated using
[`{r} strsplit(R.version$version.string, " (", fixed = TRUE)[[1]][1]`](https://www.r-project.org).
Please see the Session Information sections at the bottom of each report to see
the R packages used for that particular analysis and the respective package
versions.
