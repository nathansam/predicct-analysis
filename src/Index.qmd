## Introduction

This website presents comprehensive statistical analyses from the PREdiCCt study
([NCT03282903](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03282903)), a UK-wide
prospective cohort study investigating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adult
patients. The study was designed to identify predictive biomarkers and clinical
factors associated with disease flares in people living with Crohn's disease
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

The PREdiCCt study recruited participants in clinical remission across multiple
UK centers, collecting detailed baseline characteristics including demographics,
disease history, biochemistry markers, dietary patterns, and psychosocial
factors. Participants were followed prospectively to identify disease flares,
enabling comprehensive survival analyses to understand factors influencing
time-to-flare outcomes.

This analysis website provides two main categories of statistical reports:

- [**Baseline Analyses**](Baseline/Introduction.qmd): Comprehensive descriptive
  statistics of participant recruitment, demographics, IBD characteristics,
  biochemistry profiles, dietary patterns, and summary tables comparing key
  variables across disease types and faecal calprotecin categories.

- [**Survival Analyses**](Survival/Introduction.qmd): Time-to-flare analyses
  examining both patient-reported and objective flare definitions, with
  controlled analyses investigating associations between baseline factors
  (particularly faecal calprotectin levels and dietary patterns) and disease
  outcomes.

All analyses are conducted using reproducible research practices with
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), ensuring
transparency and scientific rigor. The reports include both exploratory data
visualizations and formal statistical modeling, with results presented in HTML
format.

This work uses data provided by patients and collected by the NHS as part of
their care and support. We are grateful to participants and their IBD care
teams for their support. 

## Using this website

The code button at the top of each page can
be used to show all code blocks instead of clicking on the code buttons for each
individual block of code. Moving the mouse pointer over any citations in a
report will produce a pop up box with reference details. Clicking on the
citation will link to the bibliography at the bottom of the page. 

## Software versions

All analyses have been generated using
[`{r} strsplit(R.version$version.string, " (", fixed = TRUE)[[1]][1]`](https://www.r-project.org).
Please see the Session Information sections at the bottom of each report to see
the R packages used for that particular analysis and the respective package
versions.
